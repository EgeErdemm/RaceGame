By pressing the Gas button, the car accelerates. When the RPM reaches the redline, you must shift gears, or the car will be unable to accelerate further. If shifting is done in the orange zone, the current speed increases by 10. Shifting in the green zone adds 20 to the current speed. There are no rewards for shifting in the red or gray zones.

Each gear shift reduces the rate of acceleration, and the car can only shift up to 4th gear. Additionally, the car has a maximum speed (maxSpeed) that it cannot exceed, no matter the gear or conditions.
